        ==============
        Word to Number
        ==============
        This is a Python module to convert number words (eg. twenty one) to numeric digits (21). It works for positive numbers upto the range of 999,999,999,999 (i.e. billions).
        
        ++++++++++++
        Installation
        ++++++++++++
        Please ensure that you have **updated pip** to the latest version before installing word2number.
        
        You can install the module using Python Package Index using the below command.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          pip install word2number
        
        Make sure you install all requirements given in requirements.txt
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        +++++
        Usage
        +++++
        First you have to import the module using the below code.
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from word2number import w2n
        
        Then you can use the **word_to_num** method to convert a number-word to numeric digits, as shown below.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> print w2n.word_to_num("two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty four")
            2003984
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('two point three')) 
            2.3
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('112')) 
            112
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('point one')) 
            0.1
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('one hundred thirty-five')) 
            135
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('million million'))
            Error: Redundant number! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)
            None
        
            >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('blah'))
            Error: No valid number words found! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)
            None
